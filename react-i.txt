1. Features of React
   
   1. JSX = JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should lokk like. By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.

   2. Components = Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app consists od multiple Components. Components in react basically return a JSX code that tells what should be rendered on the screen. In react, we mainly have two types of Components:
        a. Class Components = A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions. A Class Component is a JavaScript class that extends React.Component which  has a render method. The JSX to render will bw returned inside the render method.
        ex. class Car extends React.Component {
            render() {
                return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
            }
            }

        b. Function Component = Functional components are simply JavaScript functions. We can create a functional component to React by writing a JavaScript function.
